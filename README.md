<h1>How I solved  ðŸ¤–</h1>

<li>For the solution of the first topic I used the display grid. I still didn't know the function so it was necessary to spend a lot of time studying its operation. I see that if I already had knowledge about it, my old projects a simpler construction.
<li>The toggle menu is still not in a way I like. I need to develop myself better in this part.
